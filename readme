QR Code Generator

Introduction
The QR Code Generator is a simple web application that allows users to generate QR codes from any given text or URL. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project provides a clean and user-friendly interface for quickly creating QR codes, making it easier to share links and information effortlessly.

 Features
- User-Friendly Interface: Clean and intuitive design for easy use.
- Instant QR Code Generation: Generates QR codes dynamically as users enter text or URLs.
- Efficient API Integration: Uses an external API to create QR codes.
- Responsive Design: Works across different screen sizes.
- Real-Time Input Handling: Listens for user input changes and prevents unnecessary API calls.

Technologies Used
- HTML: Structure of the web page.
- CSS: Styling for a visually appealing user interface.
- JavaScript: Handles logic and QR code generation using an API.

Installation & Usage
Prerequisites
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- An active internet connection

Steps to Run the Project
1. Download or Clone the Repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/qr-code-generator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory
   ```sh
   cd qr-code-generator
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a Web Browser
   - Double-click `index.html`, or
   - Open it using a live server extension (if using VS Code)

 How It Works
1. Users enter a URL or text in the input field.
2. Clicking the Generate QR Code button triggers a request to an external API.
3. The application fetches a QR code image based on the entered text/URL.
4. The generated QR code is displayed on the page.
5. If the input field is cleared, the QR code is hidden.

Source Code
HTML (index.html)
The structure includes an input field, a button to generate the QR code, and an image placeholder for the QR code output.

CSS (style.css)
Defines the styling of the interface, including responsiveness, colors, and layout.

JavaScript (script.js)
- Listens for button clicks and input field updates.
- Fetches the QR code from an API and updates the UI.
- Prevents unnecessary API calls by checking for repeated values.

API Used
The project utilizes the following API for QR code generation:
```
https://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/?size=200x200&data=YOUR_TEXT_OR_URL
```

- **Offline Mode**: Generate QR codes without needing an external API.
